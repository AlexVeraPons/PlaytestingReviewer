# Playtesting Review Tool 
Hey there! Welcome to my Playtesting Tool repository this 
is where I’m building a new system to streamline the entire playtesting process in Unity.
It’s still under heavy construction, but I’m pumped to share what’s here so far:

## Current Features
- Metric Recording: Automatically tracks gameplay metrics so you don’t have to. by tracking events and storing timestamps and defined properties.

- Video Capturing: Records gameplay footage to sync with the metrics no more manual note-taking!

- Review Revision: A UI to visualize the video in sync with the metrics where you can manually look through the project

## Disclamer
This is a work in progress project and is still not in a state where i want to fully release it!
The newest version is in the development branch and I will be soon releasing version 1 into the master branch!
